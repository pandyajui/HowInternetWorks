<div class="introduction"><h3>What is Internet?</h3>
<p>It is a global network, which connects all the computer and non-computer equipments around the world. The primary
    goal behind these connections is communication. </p>
<h3>ICANN and Domain Names</h3>
    <p> The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit responsible for keeping the Internet secured, stable, and interoperable.<br> Domain name is the address put into the browser URL bar to reach a website.  </p>
<h3>IP Addresses,Packets,and Routing</h3>
    <p>An Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) is a unique string of character, which works as an identifier for a computer device.<br> Packets are small sets of data sent through a network with a destination. <br> The process of Routing serves the purpose of selecting a traffic route in a network or between multiple networks. </p>
<h3>DNS</h3>
    <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) acts like a phone directory. It provides a way to match website names or addresses.  </p>
<h3>HTTP and HTTPS Protocols</h3>
    <p>HTTP and HTTPS are both hypertext transfer protocol that enable the web data to be presented on screen as requested. While they are very similar, the one thing that sets them apart is HTTPS is more advanced as well as more secured. </p>
<h3>W3C,HTML, and CSS</h3>
    <p>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an organization led by Tim Berners-Lee. The primary goal of this organization is to help a World Wide Web reach its full potential by creating protocols and guidelines for a long-term growth.<br> HTML and CSS are the two significant programming languages used for building a website.  </p>
