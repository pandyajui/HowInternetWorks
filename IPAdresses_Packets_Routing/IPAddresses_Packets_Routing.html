    <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
    <p>An IP address is a unique key for a computer device on a network. This key is is known as an address that is used to identify a computer.An IP address has a specific format. A traditional IP address is 32 bits long divided into 8 bits per one part of the address. The address had 4 parts that represent the country of the network, the region, a subnetwork, and the device. With the traditional IP address form, 4 billion unique IP addresses. As there are a lot more users, they is another form for IP address which will be 128 bits long. This format is called IPv6. This format provides 340 undecillion unique addresses.    </p>
    <h2>Packets</h2>
    <p>Packets, which refer to network packets, are little containers filled with data. They are used for communication between network devices, such as the communication between a router and laptop. These packets usually contain information on where it is going to be sent along with some of the information that is being sent such as strings from a webpage. Packets are very essential in todayâ€™s world of technology because it allows the user to navigate through the internet and load the data on web pages. For example, if you are loading up Facebook on a web browser, packets are being sent back and forward from the device to the router and vice versa in order to maintain a steady connection and load information on the web page.</p>
    <h2>Routing</h2>
    <p>Routing is the process of selecting a path through a set of networks for the packet to travel in. This path will take the packet from the source to the destination. An example of this, not related to the internet, would be an Uber driver following a certain path to get their passenger from the source to the destination and then being able to pick up another passenger after dropping off their previous passenger. Routing is very important because it allows the data to make sure it gets to the correct location so web pages can be loaded up quickly without having to drop a packet.</p>
