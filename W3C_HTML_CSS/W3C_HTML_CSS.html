    <h2>W3C</h2>
    <p>The W3C is an international community that works with the public to develop and uphold standards for the web. Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994, this community helps lead the World Wide Web by creating Internet Protocols and guidelines for everyone to follow in order to maximize the potential of the World Wide Web. We rely on the W3C in order to properly use the World Wide Web in terms of communication, commerce, and ways to share knowledge with others. The main vision for the W3C is to share knowledge and have everyone involved on a global scale.</p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML, also known as the Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language that is used to markup documents that will be displayed on a web page. The importance of HTML is to see how the text on the web page will look like. It can either be bolded, italicized, linked to another web page and more. HTML is also used to link images, videos, and create tables on the web page. The image and videos are pulled from the server using an HTTP GET request and then displayed on the web page. HTML is important because it will create the basic structure for the web page.</p>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used to style web pages. These style sheets are usually linked for the HTML page to refer to the style sheet it's linked with. Some examples of CSS include creating a grid to have certain information displayed on certain parts of the web page, or to change the color of the background, type of font for the text, and alignment of certain images and text on the web page. CSS is very important to any web developer because it helps the web page look very organized and clean rather than having a cluttered mess. It also lets the web developer be a bit more artistic with the way they want to design the web page.</p>
